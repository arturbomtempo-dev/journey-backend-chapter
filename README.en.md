    </h1>
    <p align="center">
        This repository brings together source code, practical examples, and supplementary materials developed throughout the Journey Backend — a learning experience in back-end development with Node.js and Express, organized in partnership between WebTech Network and LEVTY. Its purpose is to support Chapter participants in studying, reviewing concepts, and deepening their practical understanding of the topics covered in classes and activities.

## 📁 Setup and Running the Application

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

It is also recommended to use a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 🚀 How to Run the Application Locally

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/arturbomtempo-dev/journey-backend-chapter.git

# Access the project folder
$ cd {folder_name}

# Run the main file
$ node index.js
```

> Note: Make sure that the index.js file is correctly configured as your project's entry point. If the file name is different, adjust the execution command accordingly.

After running the command, the server will start — usually on port `3000`.

Access the application in your browser at:

```plaintext
http://localhost:3000
```
